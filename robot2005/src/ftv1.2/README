To compile the library:

1) go in the directory src and type make. This should produce the
library libfthread.a and install it in ../lib with fthread.h in
../include. However, one assumes that gcc, make, ar, and ranlib are
available. If it is not the case, you should edit the makefile to set
correctly the corresponding variables. Same thing if ../lib or
../include are wrong.
   
2) you can verify that the installation is correct by running the
tests in the directory tests, or the examples in the directory
examples.
