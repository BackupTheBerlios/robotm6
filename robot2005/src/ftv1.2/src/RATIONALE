the link field in thread is not redondant with
the scheduler field. One can set the scheduler
and then unlink. 

ft_scheduler_react has been introduced in the 
API. Thus one can make several schedulers run in
coordination.

ft_scheduler_nd_create returns a scheduler that
does not preserve the order in which threads are
executed. It is thus nondeterministic, but can
also be run more efficiently.
